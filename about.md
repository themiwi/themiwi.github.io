I Michael Wild, a mechanical engineer by training, who put himself through a
doctorate in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). You can find the outcome of
this ordeal

I am Swiss, but moved to Linz, Austria back in 2016. I'm also a dad to two
lovely boys, husband to my beautiful wife, musician and avid reader. Further, I
am interested in politics and economics.

Currently I work for a company producing electro-mechanical equipment for
hydraulic power plants (i.e. water turbines). I am involved in the development
of engineering software tools and am the architect for an industrial IoT
platform we use to offer operation and maintenance services.
