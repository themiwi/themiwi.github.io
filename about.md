I am a mechanical engineer by training, who put himself through a doctorate
in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). You can find the outcome of this ordeal
[here](https://search.library.ethz.ch/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ebi01_prod009775134&context=L&vid=DADS&search_scope=default_scope&tab=default_tab&lang=en_US).

Currently I work for a company producing electro-mechanical equipment for
hydraulic power plants (i.e. water turbines). I am involved in the development
of engineering software tools and am the architect for an industrial IoT
platform we use to offer operation and maintenance services.
